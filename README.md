# Playing with Generics in Go: Making Event Payloads More Extensible

This is an example of how Go generics can be used to send event payloads.

## Installation

Pull the repo down from the [Github](https://github.com/jmwoliver/go-generics-example) page.

```bash
git clone github.com/jmwoliver/go-generics-example
```

Then navigate to the `go-generics-example` directory and build the file.

```bash
cd go-generics-example
```

## Usage

To run the project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
go run main.go --generics=true
```

This will run the example that uses generics. To run the project with the code that does not use generics, use the command:

```bash
go run main.go --generics=false
```
